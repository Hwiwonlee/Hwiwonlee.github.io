Comparing read times of CSV and RDS files using system.time()
```r
# How long does it take to read movies from CSV?
system.time(read.csv("movies.csv"))

# How long does it take to read movies from RDS?
system.time(readRDS("movies.rds"))
```

Elapsed time
- Using system.time() is convenient, but it does have its drawbacks when comparing multiple function calls. The microbenchmark package solves this problem with the microbenchmark() function.

```r
# Load the microbenchmark package
library(microbenchmark)

# Compare the two functions
compare <- microbenchmark(read.csv("movies.csv"), 
                          readRDS("movies.rds"), 
                          times = 10)

# Print compare
print(compare)

```
